# cursive
cursive is an ncurses file browser for GNU/Linux written in pure C.  
It is not very functional, nor is it extensible at all.  
The only legitimate use case I could think of is ricing with it.  
### Building & Running
(in any directory)  
```shell
git clone https://github.com/lijaesela/cursive
```  
```shell
cd cursive
```  
```shell
make
```  
```shell
./cursive
```  
### Configuration
Configuration is compiled into the program via ``config.h``.
There are options for keybindings, a few basic behavioral options, and some theming options.
