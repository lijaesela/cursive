# cursive
cursive is an ncurses file browser for GNU/Linux written in pure C.  
It is not very functional, nor is it extensible at all.  
The only legitimate use case I could think of is ricing with it, becuase it looks kind of cool.  
### Building & Running

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lijaesela/cursive

### Configuration

There are options for keybindings, a few basic behavioral options, and some theming options.
