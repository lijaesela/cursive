Cursive is an ncurses file manager/browser loosely inspired by Ranger.
It uses vim keys by default, and will feel very similar to Ranger or lf.

THINGS THAT CURRENTLY WORK RELIABLY:	(keys are case sensitive)

> j and k to move down and up through files
> J and K to do this 10 at a time
> l to open files or to descend into selected directory
> h to go up one directory

> z to toggle hidden files
> n to toggle numbers next to files

> D to delete any file (that is not a directory)
> m to mkdir
> r to rename
> a to append rename to original file name
> o to open file with specific app

> $ to run a system command
> s to open an interactive shell

IN DEVELOPMENT:

> space to select files for various actions
> u to acces shell macros defined in a file
> epic abstraction in the drawing code for ranger-esque directory previews
> MAKE A NEW DRAW LOOP

IN THE FUTURE:

> the ability to delete directories





















































QUESTIONS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN ASKED:

Q: Is there an option for colors?
A: pipe it into lolcat lmao fuck you
